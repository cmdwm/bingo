 Made originally for a YouTube video on the [WillHasAwesomeShoes](https://yt.willm.xyz) channel, but now I've shared the source code and anyone can get their own version up and running.

 How to Get it Running
=================
 The most logical thing to do would be to fork this GitHub repository and [enable **GH Pages**](https://guides.github.com/features/pages/) since this is a static project.
If you aren't comfortable hosting on GitHub, you can also [remix the project](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/remix/class-bingo) on **Glitch**.

How Do Things Work Around Here?
=================
The `<td>` tags in `index.html` are where each space goes, I formatted the code in a way where it's easy to customize.

Inside of `script.js`, there's way too many functions and I realized there was an easier way to do it but it was too late!

The `style.css` file is pretty self-explanitory; it's where ~~all~~ most of the styling/CSS go for the site.

And yeah, that's pretty much it! The site is available to test live on [bingo.willm.xyz](https://bingo.willm.xyz).
